## Description
The quantitative assessment of the clustering of single cell data is a critical problem to be solved in data analysis. We present a machine learning based self-projection framework(SCCAF) to assess the clustering quality of single-cell RNA-seq data, find similar cell clusters that encode identical signature, detect potential doublets and find marker genes. On both simulated and real scRNA-Seq datasets, we illustrate the capabilities of SCCAF. We show that SCCAF greatly helps in finding encodable cell clusters and may useful contribute to the building of standard operating procedure of high-throughput single-cell sequencing data.

## Installation

- download SCCAF package
```git clone https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf.git```

- install
```python setup.py install```

## Usage
Please refer to [sccaf_example](https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf_example) for detailed usage of the program.
